# Python-Password-Generator-Program

This is a simple password generator program I made in Python.

This program creates a select number of passwords based on custom length and character options. There are 4 variable sets of characters which can be selected by simply changing the boolean to 'True' or 'False':

- numbers = '0123456789'
- lower_letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
- higher_letters = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
- symbols = '!@#$%^&*()_-=+[]{}<>,.?/\\|~'

Once options have been selected, the program will create a virtual 'pool' containing the characters listed in each chosen option. Past this specific point is where the password length and amount can be picked.
After all these conditions and options have been completed, the program will then output into the terminal the selected amount of passwords which contain characters that have been combined together and randomized till the limit of the length. 

Editing Instructions
